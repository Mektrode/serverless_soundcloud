# A Serverless Stream of Conscience.

A audio streaming application using React.js for the front-end and Node.js (Socket.io & Express) for the back-end. All tied together using a Rest API.

The plan once complete, is to slowly convert this project into a serverless application working on AWS Lambda! 

## To Start, Clone Me 🙋‍♂️ Then Follow The Instructions 👇🏾

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Launches both the front and back end at the same time.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> Note: This application is a simple prototype so no tests will be written unless necessary.

### `npm run build???`

> Note: There is no build script for this project yet due to it's premature stage in development.

**Happy `streamin` 🤪!!!**
